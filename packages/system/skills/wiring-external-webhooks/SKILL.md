# Wiring external webhooks to HTTP signals

A `provider: http` signal in `workspace.yml` exposes a URL. To make
something fire it you register the URL with the upstream system
(Bitbucket, Jira, custom). Friday's webhook-tunnel is the public entry
point — it forwards the request body to atlasd's signal endpoint, then
your workspace agent parses it.

## URL pattern — always `/hook/raw/`

```
https://<public-tunnel-url>/hook/raw/<workspaceId>/<signalId>
```

- `<workspaceId>` is the runtime id (e.g. `light_papaya`, not the friendly name).
- `<signalId>` is the signal's key in `workspace.yml`.

**Only `github` and `raw` providers ship built-in.** Bitbucket, Jira, and
anything else go through `raw`. The raw provider:

- **Does not verify signatures.** If you need HMAC, do it in the agent
  (see "Verifying signatures in the agent" below).
- **Does not filter events.** Every webhook the upstream sends reaches
  the workspace; the agent decides what to act on.
- **Does not transform the payload.** The agent reads the full raw body
  via `ctx.input.config or ctx.input.raw`.

**Do NOT** point the external service at `/api/workspaces/.../signals/...` —
that's atlasd's internal direct path, not reachable through the tunnel.

## Fire-and-forget by default — `?nowait=true`

The webhook-tunnel posts to atlasd with `?nowait=true` so atlasd
publishes to JetStream and returns 202 immediately. The cascade runs
async on the CASCADES consumer; the tunnel doesn't hold the HTTP
connection open waiting for it.

This is the right shape for ANY caller that publishes a signal but
doesn't need the cascade's `output` to compose its own response —
webhooks, cron, fire-and-forget RPC. Avoids the failure mode where the
upstream (Bitbucket's 30s deadline, etc.) times out before a long
cascade finishes, even though the cascade itself runs to completion in
the background.

If you ARE building a custom forwarder or RPC client that needs to
follow the cascade, two options:

- Add `Accept: text/event-stream` to the POST — same publish, streams
  cascade events on the same response.
- Or use `?nowait=true` and then `GET
  /api/workspaces/<wsId>/signals/stream/<correlationId>` (SSE) with the
  correlationId returned from the 202.

See `friday-cli` skill section 3 for the full three-mode breakdown
(nowait / sync JSON / SSE).

## Env var that controls the secret

The only env var the webhook-tunnel reads for HMAC verification is
`WEBHOOK_SECRET`. It lives in `~/.atlas/.env` and applies to all webhook
providers that verify signatures (today: github).

Provider-prefixed variants (`BITBUCKET_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) are silently ignored —
nothing reads them. If a user or agent mentions one, redirect them to
`WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Get the tunnel URL in one call

```bash
curl -sk https://localhost:9090/status | jq
# → { "url": "https://...trycloudflare.com", "secret": "...",
#     "providers": ["github","raw"], ... }
```

`/status` is the single source of truth — it shows the current
`trycloudflare` URL (rotates on tunnel restart), the `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
(only used by the github provider), and which providers are registered.
Run it FIRST when something's wrong before guessing.

## Bitbucket Cloud — UI steps

1. Repo settings → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
2. **Title**: anything (e.g. `Friday`)
3. **URL**: paste `https://<tunnel-url>/hook/raw/<workspaceId>/<signalId>`
4. **Secret**: leave blank (the raw provider doesn't verify); set only if
   the agent will verify itself (see below)
5. **Status**: Active
6. **Triggers**: pick the events you want. Bitbucket's "Choose from a
   full list..." panel exposes ~23 trigger types; the ones most often
   useful for agents:
   - `repo:push` (body has `push.changes[]`)
   - `repo:commit_status_created` / `repo:commit_status_updated` (body
     has `commit_status` — failed builds, etc.)
   - `pullrequest:created` / `pullrequest:updated` / `pullrequest:approved`
     / `pullrequest:fulfilled` (body has `pullrequest`)
   - `pullrequest:comment_created` (body has `pullrequest` + `comment`)

   Bitbucket retries 3× on non-2xx. The event type itself only travels
   in the `x-event-key` header — and the raw provider does NOT forward
   headers, so the agent infers from payload shape.

## Verifying signatures in the agent

The raw provider drops request headers (no `x-hub-signature` reaches
the agent). If you need verification for a Bitbucket webhook today,
treat the cloudflared tunnel URL + workspace-id-in-path as the trust
boundary, OR set a Bitbucket secret you also store in the workspace
`.env` and compute the HMAC yourself on the body (the agent reads the
secret via `os.environ[...]` and the raw body via `ctx.input.config or
ctx.input.raw`). Pick an env var name that does NOT collide with
`WEBHOOK_SECRET` — e.g. `MY_WORKSPACE_BB_SECRET`.

## Reading the payload in the agent

The signal payload sits under `ctx.input.config` (the runtime auto-seeds
prepareResult from signal payloads under that key — see
`writing-friday-python-agents` Tier 0). Fallback to `ctx.input.raw` for
signal-direct invocations:

```python
payload = ctx.input.config or ctx.input.raw
```

Bitbucket's payload top-level keys depend on the event:
| Has key            | Event family                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `pullrequest`      | PR (created/updated/approved/etc.)|
| `commit_status`    | Build status                      |
| `push.changes`     | Push                              |
| `comment`          | Comment-related sub-event         |
| `approval`         | Approved / Unapproved sub-event   |

## Loop trap — do NOT subscribe to events your own agent creates

If your agent posts a PR comment in response to a webhook, **do not
subscribe to `pullrequest:comment_created`** — your own comment will
re-fire the webhook → re-trigger the agent → infinite loop.

If you must process comment events:

- Guard at the agent level: skip when the comment author is the same
  identity as your bot's bitbucket-mcp credential, OR
- Guard on the content: skip when the comment body matches an exact
  marker (`"ACK"`, `"/friday processed"`).

Write the guard before the first send — a missing guard has been
observed to produce 18+ spam comments on a single PR before the loop
gets caught.

Friday's signal-level `concurrency: skip` default also blocks the
"agent acts → webhook fires → agent re-runs" cascade for the duration
of the first run, but it's a race-dependent backstop; the prompt/code
guard is the load-bearing one.

## Custom event mapping (advanced, rarely needed)

`WEBHOOK_MAPPINGS_PATH` is a YAML override for the **github** provider's
event list. It is NOT a way to register bitbucket/jira/etc. — those
providers do not exist anymore, and pointing the env at a YAML with a
`bitbucket:` block at the top level silently leaves the registry with
just `[github, raw]`. Schema for the github override:

```yaml
providers:                            # ← top-level key MUST be `providers:`
  github:
    event_header: x-github-event
    signature_header: x-hub-signature-256
    events:
      release:
        mapping:                      # ← key MUST be `mapping:`, NOT `extract:`
          tag: "release.tag_name"
          url: "release.html_url"
```

Common mistakes that produce `400 Unknown provider`:

- Top-level key is the provider name (`{"bitbucket": {...}}`) instead of
  wrapped in `providers:`.
- Each event uses `extract:` instead of `mapping:`.
- Field paths use JSONPath syntax (`$.repository.full_name`) instead of
  dot paths (`repository.full_name`).

Validate by hitting `/status` — `providers` should include any custom
provider you added (default is `[github, raw]`).

## Error catalog

| Tunnel response                                           | Cause | Fix |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| `400 Unknown provider: bitbucket. Available: github, raw` | Webhook URL points at the removed bitbucket provider. | Change the URL in the upstream system to `/hook/raw/<wsId>/<signalId>` (note: `raw`, NOT `bitbucket`). |
| `400 Unknown provider: X. Available: Y`                   | `WEBHOOK_MAPPINGS_PATH` is set to a file with the wrong shape — schema-incompatible YAML silently leaves the registry with only `raw`. | `unset WEBHOOK_MAPPINGS_PATH` or fix the file (top-level `providers:` key, per-event `mapping:`). |
| `401 missing x-hub-signature header` (github only)        | Friday has `WEBHOOK_SECRET` set but the GitHub webhook has no Secret. | Paste the secret into the GitHub form. |
| `401 invalid signature` (github only)                     | Secrets don't match. | Verify byte-for-byte; restart daemon after `.env` change. |
| `200 {"status":"skipped","reason":"irrelevant event"}` (github only) | github provider received an event not in its mapping. | Subscribe to a mapped event OR add a `WEBHOOK_MAPPINGS_PATH` override. For bitbucket/jira this response can no longer occur — they go through `raw` which forwards everything. |
| `502 Cannot reach atlasd: context deadline exceeded`      | Signal handler ran longer than the tunnel forwarder's 30s deadline. | Split the work: fast signal handler fires an internal signal; the slow part runs async. |
