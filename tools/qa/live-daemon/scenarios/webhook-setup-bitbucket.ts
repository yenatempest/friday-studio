/**
 * Webhook-setup (Bitbucket) eval — chat-driven setup-guidance contract.
 *
 * When a user with a `provider: http` signal in their workspace asks
 * workspace-chat "how do I configure Bitbucket to call this signal?",
 * the response must answer with the canonical wiring details (URL
 * pattern, env var, signature header, event allowlist, /status
 * debugging) and explicitly avoid the foot-guns Marc hit in the
 * 2026-05-15 chat dump (BITBUCKET_WEBHOOK_SECRET, malformed
 * webhook-mappings.json, `/hook/raw/` bypass advice).
 *
 * Two variants prove the `wiring-external-webhooks` skill is what
 * drives the right answer:
 *
 *   - WITH-SKILL (positive): the skill content is appended to the
 *     system prompt as if `load_skill` had been called and surfaced.
 *     Must pass every contract check.
 *   - WITHOUT-SKILL (negative / control): just the bare workspace-chat
 *     prompt.txt. Must FAIL at least one of the "knows the URL pattern
 *     and env var" checks — proves the model doesn't already have this
 *     domain knowledge from training and that the skill is the carrier.
 *
 * The full scenario list (11 total) is wired in `main()` near the bottom
 * of this file — keep that list as the source of truth for count.
 *
 * Same direct-Anthropic-call shape as `secret-input-guard.ts` and
 * `connect-service-on-auth-error.ts` — no daemon spawn, no workspace
 * registration, ~15s per run.
 *
 * Run:
 *   ./tools/qa/live-daemon/scenarios/webhook-setup-bitbucket.ts
 *   ./tools/qa/live-daemon/scenarios/webhook-setup-bitbucket.ts --only with-skill

// cascade runs. Agent should recommend ?nowait=true and the 202 + SSE
// stream-by-correlationId pattern — that's exactly what the bus was

// loop and consuming the cascade's `output` + `summary` as input to the
// next iteration. Sync mode is the cleanest fit: one POST, one
// JSON envelope back, deterministic shape, no SSE parsing, no polling.

// running cascade (debugging UI, log tail, watching steps as they happen).
// Agent should recommend the in-handler SSE path — Accept: text/event-stream
// on the trigger POST. There is no GET-follow-by-correlationId endpoint:
// the cascade response is published to a core-NATS subject without replay,
